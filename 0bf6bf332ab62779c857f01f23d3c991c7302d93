      "message": "For the requirements listed below for aarch64, we can surely install them on x86 too:\n- xz will be unused - we need it on aarch64 because the aarch64 cloud qcow2 is archived using xz;\n- python-pip will be required on x86 anyway if we use the same DIB from pip;\n- gdisk...util-linux will be required on x86 if we add UEFI support for the output image generation;\n\nThe problem remains `syslinux`, which is not available on aarch64 to be installed, so we\u0027ll still have to keep at least 1 `%ifarch` here ...",
