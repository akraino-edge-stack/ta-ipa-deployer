      "message": "This is intentional, afaik build_config.ini is only used for the golden image build and requires extra parsing for its variables to be used (currently only present in create_golden_image.sh, not for the TA RPM builds); so unfortunately I don\u0027t think we can reuse those variables here.\n\nNote that on x86 golden image uses version 1809, while here we use 1801 - I left this misalignment unchanged to limit the impact of this change; although I think we can later align them.",
